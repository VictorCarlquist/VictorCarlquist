- Python 🐍
- Django
- HTML
- CSS3
- Javascript
- PostgreSQL
- Celery
- Sentry
- Docker 🐳
- Pytest 🧪
- CI/CD 🪛
- Scrum.

In my professional career I already worked part-time as IT professor 👨‍🏫 in two differents educational institutes 🏫 (IFSP and UNIVR). I had been a Mozilla 🦊 volunteer where I had contributed to optimize the javascript’s `.split()` function. At mozilla I had improved my knowledges in **C++** and **Javascript** 🚀.

I am graduated 👨‍🎓 in Analysis and Systems Development (IFSP) and I have specializations in Software Quality (SENAC) and Systems Security (CENES).

My goals are to build new systems to help people 🧑‍🤝‍, improve myself professionally and mentally 🧠 and meet awesome people 🍻.
